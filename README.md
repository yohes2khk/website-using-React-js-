INTRODUCTION
• React is a popular JavaScript library used for building user interfaces (Uls) in web applications.

• React is widely used in web development due to its fast rendering capabilities and ability to handle complex UI components.

• Ul for React refers to the visual interface of the web applicationbuilt using React.


• Ul for React is created using a combination of HTML, CSS. and JavaScript.

•React(known as react.js) is a free and open-source
front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces
based on components. 

• It is maintained by Meta and a community of individual developers and companies.

• React can be used as a base in the development of single-page, mobile, or server-rendered applications with frameworks like Next.js.

•ReactJS provides minimal and solid feature set to kick- start a web application.

• It can be used to develop small applications as well as big, complex applications.



• The main objective of ReactJS is to develop User Interfaces (UI) that improves the speed of the apps. 
It uses virtual DOM (JavaScript object), which improves the performance of the app. 
The JavaScript virtual DOM is faster than the regular DOM.


• In React, you develop your applications by creating reusable components that you can think of as independent Lego blocks.
 These components are individual pieces of a final interface, which, when assembled, form the application's entire user interface.
